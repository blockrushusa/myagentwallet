# üîí SECURITY WARNINGS - MyAgentWallet

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SECURITY NOTICE

**This application is for TEMPORARY use only. DO NOT use for production or store significant funds.**

## üö® IDENTIFIED SECURITY RISKS

### **CRITICAL RISKS:**

1. **Client-Side Key Generation**
   - **Risk**: All private keys are generated in browser JavaScript
   - **Threat**: Malicious browser extensions, XSS attacks, memory dumps
   - **Mitigation**: Use only in trusted environments, clear browser data after use

2. **No Hardware Security Module (HSM)**
   - **Risk**: Private keys exist in software memory
   - **Threat**: Memory scraping, process dumps
   - **Mitigation**: Consider hardware wallets for production use

3. **Browser Storage**
   - **Risk**: WalletConnect sessions stored in localStorage
   - **Threat**: Cross-site scripting access to stored sessions
   - **Mitigation**: Clear localStorage after each session

### **HIGH RISKS:**

4. **Network Security**
   - **Risk**: HTTP traffic in development
   - **Threat**: Man-in-the-middle attacks
   - **Mitigation**: Always use HTTPS in production

5. **Dependency Security**
   - **Risk**: Third-party crypto libraries
   - **Threat**: Supply chain attacks, backdoors
   - **Mitigation**: Regular security audits, dependency scanning

### **MEDIUM RISKS:**

6. **Web Worker Entropy**
   - **Risk**: Fallback to weak randomness
   - **Threat**: Predictable key generation
   - **Mitigation**: Validate crypto.getRandomValues availability

7. **Memory Persistence**
   - **Risk**: Private keys persist in JavaScript memory
   - **Threat**: Memory dumps, garbage collection delays
   - **Mitigation**: Implement secure memory clearing

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

### **For Users:**
- ‚úÖ Use only for testing and temporary wallets
